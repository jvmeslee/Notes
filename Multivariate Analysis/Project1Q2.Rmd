(b) List groups that appear to be relatively more tightly clustered than other groups. Groups 2, 3, and 7 seem to appear relatively more tightly clustered than other groups.

(c) List groups that appear to be relatively widely dispersed. For each group listed, indicate at least one of the scatter plots to justify the choice. 
Groups 1(the plot of variable C and G), 4(the plot of variable C and G), 5(the plot of variable G and H), 6(the plot of variable C and H), and 8(the plot of variable C and H) seem to appear relatively widely dispersed.

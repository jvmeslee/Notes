2. The symbol pi in this problem is the response variable badh, a self assessment of their health, with 1=bad health and 0=not bad health.

3.
```{r}
mod.fit <- glm(formula = badh ~ age,family=binomial(link=logit),data=DoctorVisits)
mod.fit$coefficients
```
(a) logit(pi.hat) = -4.2461 + 0.0557age

(b) Estimated Probabilities of bad health for women at ages 20, 40, and 60.
```{r}
age20 = -4.2461 + 0.0557*20
age40 = -4.2461 + 0.0557*40
age60 = -4.2461 + 0.0557*60
c(age20,age40,age60)
```
